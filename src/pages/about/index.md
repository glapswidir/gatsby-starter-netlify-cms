I am Magda, founder Day Nursery Center.I have an extensive experience as a nanny, babysitter and Au Pair which I gained during my travelling around Europe, USA and Australia. I have always loved working with children! It is such a great experience to play a role in the kids simple, and joyful life. It is beautiful to have the opportunity to see how they develop as individuals and help them to reach important milestones and developmental goals. However, getting regular babysitting jobs sometimes was not easy.

Moreover, my partner Wojtek was on other side. As a parent without an extended family, he challenged many times to find a trusted, reliable and occasional care for his daughter.

As a power couple, we decided to join forces and find a great solution for both - parents and sitters.That is how we created Day Nursery Center.





We are slightly different compared to other websites or apps. We are not a child agency, we take a step forward and provide trusted babysitters on demand. Our platform smoothly connects parents and sitters together.

As a parent, you can find finest and trusted care for your children in a few simple steps. Among many features and depending on your needs you can choose a vetted babysitter, your perfect match.

As a babysitter, you have a great opportunity to connect with needy parents by showcasing your experience and real-time availability.
